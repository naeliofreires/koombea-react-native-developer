# Koombea | React Native Developer

This application was built using React Native Framework.

I added a few libraries to help me with the development process and now I will give a brief explanation of why I choose these libraries.

___

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- add types on our components

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- add styles around of our components

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
- to handle w/ the data around of the app using flux architecture

[Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/usage/)
- to keep the last actions from the user saved. (We used this to rehydrate the store)

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- to do requests for the API
